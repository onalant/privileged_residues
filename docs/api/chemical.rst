Ray selection protocols (`privileged_residues.chemical`)
--------------------------------------------------------
.. module:: privileged_residues.chemical

Privileged Residues operates on the principle that geometrically constrained
interactions can be characterized by the orientations of a select number of
high-importance atoms. This module contains the ray selectors necessary for
such operations.
